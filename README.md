Similar to common Wikis and also the main page of http://www.openstreetmap.org the website shows a narrow menu on the left side, most of the page is used for the display of the map. In contrast to most Wikis the menu is not static, but rather the content of the map can be browsed in categories. For the map a special style has been developed (sorry guys, I neither like the default Mapnik nor Osmarender styles), and special overlays are displayed to support the current browsed categories. When you click on an object (either from the list or directly on the map) informations on this object are displayed.

- [Computational-Journalism-for-People-s-Daily-Opinion](https://github.com/puconghan/Computational-Journalism-for-People-s-Daily-Opinion) - Statistical topic models – one of the sub fields of machine learning and natural language processing – provide a data-driven framework for analyzing collections of text documents. It has become one of the most frequently used tools for computational journalism used to investigate abstract topics and keywords that occur in a collection of text documents. Digital journalists can use such tools to extract frequently appearing terms, and to analyze the trend of a particular news brand or stories about a social event. Articles, analyses and documents written in Chinese have become increasingly important for multimedia stories about China. Available Chinese archives on the Internet might contain stories that require digital journalists to apply appropriate topic modeling tools. Unlike English and other alphabetic languages, the basic structural unit of Chinese language is character encoded in Guobiao GB18030 or Unicode.  I implement apps using the Chinese topic-modeling tools jieba for computational journalism. This app analyzes articles from the opinion archive of the People’s Daily and generate a list of frequently appearing words using the keyword extraction tool provided by the jieba library.

- [Stemmer---PT](https://github.com/salomaojunior/Stemmer---PT) - Stemming is the process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form – generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since 1968. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query broadening, a process called conflation. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers.
